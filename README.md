The Great Canine Creation Game (started over on 05/25/2016)

//An idea I've had for a while, The Great Canine Creation Game is a web based simulation game, meant to follow the creation of new breeds of dog. Dog breeds often have a rich history behind them that many people are unaware of. This game is meant to allow you to experience the creation of a new breed from the very beginning.

//Starting with a single pair of wild dogs, a la wolves, the user will explore the land, finding adventures to traverse, prey to hunt, and other dogs to catch. The more you play, the more the world develops around you. From a small frontier ranch to a great sprawling metropoly, history will play out around you.
